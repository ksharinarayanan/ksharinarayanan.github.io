                So, let's start from the basics, so that everyone is in the same track! 
                <br />
                <br />

                <b>What does the source page contain?</b>
                <br />
                <br />

                It contains the HTML, CSS and javascript code which is powering the websites, apart from the backend services if any.
                The HTML and CSS code are mostly doing static stuff and so this won't be of much interest except when you are hunting for bugs like XSS.
                <br />
                <br />

                <b>What remains? Javascript!</b>

                <br /><br />

                This is the stuff that we are most interested in.ðŸ˜‹
                <br />
                Javascript is responsible for manipulating the DOM of the website, or in other words making static content dynamic. You can't be displaying an user specific page just with HTML and CSS. The website must use a backend setup, and use javascript to query endpoints, fetch a particular data and change the contents depending on who is viewing the page.

                <br /><br />

                <b>What could possibly go wrong here?</b>

                <br /><br />

                Not all endpoints are hit! There may be endpoints which the developers might have forgotten to remove. They might be endpoints, which are current not used by the company, but still in the source. Something like <code>/api/admin/analytics?user=michaelben</code>. Let's say the company previously used this endpoint for analytics, and it returns all the user's usage data or leaks any other sensitive data on changing the <code>user</code> parameter.

                <br /><br />

                <b>Yeah, it seems like looking through javascript code actually is useful. So, do I have to manually look through every page I visit everytime?</b>

                <br /><br />

                This is where my friend <a href="https://github.com/micha3lb3n/SourceWolf/">SourceWolf</a> comes in. He is ready to do all the hard word for you. You just need to provide the list of URLs, and he crawls the responses for you to find all the endpoints.
                <br /><br />
                He currently only searches for endpoints in the files, but you can expect in the future that he will be adding more tricks up his sleeve like creating a custom wordlist for a specific target based on the words obtained from the source, and flagging secret api keys leaked in the source.

                <br /><br />

                He lives <a href="https://github.com/micha3lb3n/SourceWolf/">here</a>. Do pay him a visit. He's feeling lonely out there!

                It can also serve as a endpoint bruteforcer and something that can get you the status codes of a list of URLs really fast. For more detailed information, check out the docs!

                <br /><br />

                An amazing feature which SourceWolf has is, it automatically checks for updates right from the terminal everytime he is run, and he notifies the user along with <b>any bug fixes and new features</b> added to the new version. You can also update SourceWolf directly from the terminal without the need for you to go the repo for you to clone it back again every time you want to update.

                <br /><br />
